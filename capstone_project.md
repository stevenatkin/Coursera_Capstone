# Business Trends in Areas Surrounding Community Colleges

## Introduction

With the rising cost of tuition many students are gravitating to community colleges and 
certificate based learning programs that are more affordable than 
traditional four year programs. With this in mind, many students are relocating 
to some of the fastest growing cities to both meet long term career goals and improve their 
short term job prospects as many students frequently require a source of income during their studies.

This shift in learning and migration represents opportunities for businesses 
to provide goods and services that are in close proximity to community colleges to 
meet the needs of students. Many of these needs are similar to students in traditional college programs, 
though some may be more specifically aligned to community college students and part-time students. To identify 
these potential business opportunities the three fastest growing US cities<sup>[1](#uscensus)</sup> 
(Phoenix Arizona, San Antonio Texas, and Fort Worth Texas) and associated community colleges are studied.
 
Each of the surrounding areas in close proximity to community colleges within these cities are 
analyzed to discern the types of businesses that have been established, 
the general interests, employment opportunities, and associated costs of living across the wider area. 
This analysis reveals the types of businesses that may be suitable in other cities that are in 
close proximity to community colleges that have yet to experience the same level of rapid growth.

## Intended Audience
This paper's research is intended for small to medium size business owners looking to identify and establish 
suitable types of business venues in areas that are in close proximity to community colleges.

## Data and Research Methodology

This paper uses data from Foursquare<sup>[2](#foursquare)</sup>, Zillow<sup>[3](#zillow)</sup>, 
The US Census<sup>[1](#uscensus)</sup>, and The National Center for Education and Statistics<sup>[4](#nces)</sup> 
to generate insights, identify patterns, and uncover business trends in close proximity to community colleges 
within Phoenix Arizona, San Antonio Texas, and Fort Worth Texas. Clustering techniques and map visualization 
will be applied to segment and cluster businesses within each of the surrounding community college areas to better 
understand their similarities and differences. 

### Sample Foursquare Data
Some of the types of data from Foursquare that will be analyzed include restaurants as shown in Fig. 1.
